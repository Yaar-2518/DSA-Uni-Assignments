Consider the following code:   
```
Void S(int *x, int &y, int* &z, int w) // This Line
{
    int* t; // This Line

    t = y;
    
    x = y + z ;

    y =  z + t ;

    z =  x + y ;

    w = t + w;

    cout << w << x << y << z << endl;
}

main() // This Line
{
    int a = 1 , b = 2 , *c = new int(3), *d = new int(4) ; // This Line

    S( a , b , c , d ) ;

    cout << a << b << c << d;
}
```
